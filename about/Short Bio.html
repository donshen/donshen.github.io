  <p>Zhengyuan (Don) Shen is a senior Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering student at Georgia Institute of Technology, where he works as an undergraduate researcher
    with Prof. Christopher W. Jones. Don developed synthesis and pyrolysis strategies for Co-, Ni-, and Cu-based Metal Organic Frameworks (MOFs) and their catalytic applications
    in selective hydrogenation reactions. Don's current research interests include heterogeneous catalysis, separation, and surface chemistry. Prior to Jone's Lab, Don worked
    as a research assistant in Prof. Elsa Reichmanis Group on polymeric semiconductor synthesis and characterization.</p>
  <p>Don interned at Micromeritics Instrument Corporation, Norcross, GA in Spring 2016. He assisted Dr. Jacek Jagiello in developing 2D-NLDFT (Two-Dimensional Non-Local Density Function Theorem) models for porous carbon materials. </p>
  <p>Don is also serving as an undergraduate teaching assistant in Gatch CHBE department. So far, he have TAed three chemical engineering major courses: Transport Processes I (Summer 2016), Thermodynamics II (Fall 2016), Kinetics and Reactor Design (Spring 2017) </p>
